## üì¶ Installation

You‚Äôll need **Node.js (version 14 or higher)** and **npm** installed on your system.

```bash
npm install -g kenat-cli
````

Once installed, you can run the `kenat` command from anywhere in your terminal.

## üöÄ Usage

Kenat-CLI can be used in two primary ways: **Interactive Mode** for a guided experience, or **Direct Commands** for quick, specific actions.

### üîÅ Interactive Mode

For the most user-friendly experience, simply run the command without any arguments:

```bash
kenat
```

This launches the interactive REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop), where you can type commands like `today`, `calendar`, or `help`.

To exit the interactive mode, type `exit` or press `Ctrl + C`.
